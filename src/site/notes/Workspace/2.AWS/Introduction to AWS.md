## Introduction to AWS (Amazon Web Services)

**Amazon Web Services (AWS)** is a cloud computing platform provided by Amazon. It offers a wide range of services that help individuals and organizations build, manage, and scale applications without having to invest in physical hardware or infrastructure.

### What is Cloud Computing?

Before diving deeper into AWS, it’s important to understand cloud computing.  
Cloud computing means **storing and accessing data and programs over the internet instead of your computer’s hard drive**. It allows you to:

- Access services on demand (whenever you need them)
    
- Pay only for what you use
    
- Avoid the hassle of setting up physical servers
    

### Why AWS?

Launched in **2006**, AWS is the **most widely used cloud platform in the world**. It powers everything from startups and government agencies to large enterprises like Netflix, NASA, and Airbnb.

Some reasons why AWS is popular:

- **Global Availability**: Data centers around the world
    
- **Scalability**: Start small, grow big without changing systems
    
- **Reliability**: High uptime and secure systems
    
- **Pay-as-you-go** pricing model
    
- **Wide range of services** (computing, storage, databases, machine learning, etc.)

### Key Concepts of AWS

Here are a few fundamental services you’ll frequently encounter:

|Service|Category|Description|
|---|---|---|
|**EC2** (Elastic Compute Cloud)|Compute|Virtual servers to run your applications|
|**S3** (Simple Storage Service)|Storage|Store files and data securely|
|**RDS** (Relational Database Service)|Database|Managed databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL|
|**Lambda**|Compute|Run code without managing servers (serverless)|
|**IAM** (Identity and Access Management)|Security|Manage users and permissions securely|

### Real-Life Analogy

Imagine building a website. Traditionally, you’d need to:

- Buy a physical server
    
- Set up networking
    
- Handle backups, updates, and maintenance
    

With AWS, you can do all this **online**, by clicking a few buttons. It’s like renting an apartment instead of building your own house — faster, cheaper, and easier to maintain.
