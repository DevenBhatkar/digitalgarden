### ðŸ“Œ What is a Class?

A **class** is a **blueprint** or **template** used to define objects.  
It groups **data (variables)** and **behaviors (methods)** together in a structured way.

### ðŸ§¸ What is an Object?

An **object** is a **real instance** of a class â€” it occupies memory and can be used to access variables and methods defined in the class.

---

### ðŸ”§ Example:

```java
class Pen {
    String color;
    String type; // ballpoint or gel

    public void write() {
        System.out.println("Writing something...");
    }
}
```

- `Pen` is a class.
    
- It has two variables: `color`, `type`.
    
- It has a method: `write()`.
    

You can now create an object:

```java
Pen pen1 = new Pen();      // Create an object
pen1.color = "blue";       // Assign value
pen1.type = "gel";         // Assign value
pen1.write();              // Output: Writing something...
```
